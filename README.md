# NSS Exercise: reindeer

## Project Description
> Loop through all the reindeer in the array, and add the name of the reindeer to the single HTML `<div>` element provided. The name of the reindeer should be prepended with the corresponding color from the other array.

## Final Product
This was another project to practice Javascript.
In this project we used Javascript to loop over two arrays but were tasked to only show a number of colors no greater then the length of the reindeer array.

## How to Run it
Must have Node installed first
```
$ git clone https://github.com/alexsanchez728/reindeer.git
$ cd reindeer/
$ npm install http-server -g
$ http-server -p 8080
```

This will show up in your browser at:
`http://localhost:8080`
